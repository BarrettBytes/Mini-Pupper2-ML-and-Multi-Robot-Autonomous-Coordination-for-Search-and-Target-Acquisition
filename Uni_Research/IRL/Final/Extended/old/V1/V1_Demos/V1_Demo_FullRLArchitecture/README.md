Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) works by training an agent to make decisions that maximize cumulative rewards in an environment, using a technique designed to maintain stable and efficient learning. PPO combines policy-based and value-based methods, using two neural networks: the actor, which decides on actions, and the critic, which evaluates the state.

Here's a concise summary of how PPO works:

1. **Actor-Critic Architecture**: PPO uses an actor network to select actions and a critic network to estimate the value of states.
2. **Experience Collection**: The agent interacts with the environment to collect experiences, which include states, actions, rewards, and next states.
3. **Advantage Estimation**: PPO calculates advantages, which measure how much better an action performed compared to a baseline (the critic's value estimate).
4. **Policy Update with Clipping**: PPO updates the policy using these advantages but restricts the update step size through a clipping mechanism. This prevents drastic changes to the policy, ensuring stable learning.
5. **Value Function Update**: The critic network is trained to reduce the error in value estimation, providing accurate feedback to the actor.
6. **Iterative Learning**: The actor and critic networks are updated iteratively based on collected experiences, gradually improving the policy.

By balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions), and by maintaining stability through clipped updates, PPO effectively trains agents to achieve high performance in complex environments.
