# Model Choice:
# The selected model for this simulation is the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. PPO is a state-of-the-art 
# reinforcement learning algorithm known for its balance between simplicity and performance. It is particularly effective 
# for environments with continuous action spaces and noisy observations, making it well-suited for our quadruped robot 
# navigating a grid with obstacles and random elements. PPO's robustness and efficiency will help the robot learn optimal 
# navigation strategies in this dynamic and noisy environment.

# This simulation models a reinforcement learning (RL) environment for a quadruped robot
# equipped with a camera and lidar, designed for a search and rescue mission involving
# cats, dogs, and obstacles. The robot has a full range of motion (forward, back, left,
# right, and circular directions) and can also move up and down. It uses lidar to detect 
# obstacles and a camera with object detection to identify cats and dogs. The robot is 
# rewarded for approaching cats and penalized for approaching dogs and hitting obstacles.
# The simulation operates on a grid with random distribution of cats, dogs, and obstacles,
# and includes noisy sensor readings to simulate real-world conditions. The robot does not
# have a navigation system or position awareness, relying solely on its sensors for movement
# and decision-making. The primary goal is to use RL to teach the robot to find cats and 
# avoid dogs and obstacles, with future improvements to incorporate cooperative behavior
# among multiple robots.

# The robot's actions and observations:
# - Movement: up, down, forward, back, left, right, circular directions
# - Lidar: detects distance and direction of obstacles
# - Camera: detects if a cat or dog is directly in front and if a cat is up high

# Simulation parameters:
# - Grid size: variable
# - Random distribution of 3 cats and 3 dogs
# - Obstacles placed randomly
# - Noise in all sensor readings (including direction, lidar, and camera): 10% chance of incorrect reading
# - Reward system: positive for approaching cats, negative for approaching dogs and hitting obstacles
# - Special condition: one cat placed up high, requiring the robot to look up to detect it

# Additional Steps for Deployment:
# Quantization and Optimization for Inference:
# To enable efficient inference on edge devices such as a Raspberry Pi, model quantization is crucial.
# This process involves converting a trained model's data types from float32 to more efficient formats like int8 or float16,
# reducing the model size and speeding up inference with minimal loss in accuracy.
# TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) offers tools for post-training quantization and optimization.
# Here is how to perform quantization:
# 1. Convert the trained TensorFlow model to a TensorFlow Lite model.
# 2. Apply post-training quantization.
# 3. Optimize and test the quantized model on the Raspberry Pi.

# Pseudo code for model quantization:
# import tensorflow as tf

# Convert a TensorFlow model to a TFLite model
def convert_to_tflite(model, quantize=False):
    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)

    tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the converted model
def save_tflite_model(tflite_model, filename):
