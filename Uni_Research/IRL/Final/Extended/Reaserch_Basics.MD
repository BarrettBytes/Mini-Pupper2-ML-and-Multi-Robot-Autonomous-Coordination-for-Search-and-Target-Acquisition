# Comprehensive Comparison of ML Techniques in Robot Navigation Script

## Introduction

The goal of this script is to implement the training for a neural network implementing the robot navigation for the Minipupper 2 robot. This script utilizes a grid-based environment simulation to train the robot to target cats and avoid dogs and obstacles while navigating in the most efficient way. It aims to teach the robot to navigate and efficiently scan/patrol the navigable environment.

This training regime combines several machine learning methods: behavioral cloning, reinforcement learning (RL), and curriculum learning.

### ML Methods Overview
1. **Behavioral Cloning**: Behavioral cloning is a method of generating a corpus of expert training data. The robot's neural network is then taught to mimic the expert strategies.
2. **RL**: Implemented in the second training phase, RL is where the robot utilizes its NN to select the next move. Each time it moves, it is punished for a bad action and rewarded for a good action. The NN then learns based on this reward function and improves itself through attempting the environment and getting these rewards and punishments.
3. **Curriculum Learning**: Curriculum learning is where the robot is exposed to different tasks of increasing complexity, helping the robot to learn through a more logical learning curve.

### Neural Networks
1. **RecurrentNeuralNetworkRewardNetwork**: A recurrent neural network that predicts rewards based on sequences of states and actions. It captures long-term dependencies in the action sequences, enabling the robot to make informed decisions.
2. **ShortTermContextNetwork**: A fully connected neural network that makes decisions based on immediate sensor data and actions. It helps the robot avoid immediate dangers and make quick decisions.
3. **DualNetworkPolicy**: Integrates the RecurrentNeuralNetworkRewardNetwork and ShortTermContextNetwork to make decisions considering both long-term and short-term contexts.

## 1. Behavioral Cloning (BC)

### Research Approach
The research presents a generalized BC algorithm with iterative policy improvement [1]:

```python
# Input: Demonstrations D, Policy class Π, Reward class ℱ
# Output: Trained policy π

# Initialize the first reward function f1 from the class ℱ
Initialize f1 ∈ ℱ

# Iterate over a number of iterations N
for i in 1 … N do
    # Update the policy πi using MaxEntRL with a weighted sum of previous rewards
    πi ← MaxEntRL(r = 1/i ∑ j=1 to i fj)
    # Update the reward function fi+1 to maximize the difference between expert policy πE and current policy πi
    fi+1 ← arg max f ∈ ℱ J(πE, f) − J(πi, f)
end for

# Return the policy πi with the lowest validation error
Return πi with the lowest validation error.
```

### Implementation
The implementation takes a different approach to BC:

```python
def generate_expert_data(env: SimulationGridEnvironment, num_sequences=1000, load_previous=False):
    realistic_expert = RealisticExpertPolicy(env)  # Expert generating realistic scenarios
    perfect_expert = ExpertPolicy(env)  # Perfect expert policy
    negative_expert = NegativeExpertPolicy(env)  # Policy generating negative examples
    random_policy = RandomPolicy(env)  # Random policy for variety in data
    
    db_handler = SQLiteDatabaseHandler(DB_PATH)  # Database handler for storing expert data
    db_handler.initialize_db()  # Initialize the database
    
    if not load_previous:
        db_handler.clear_db()  # Clear previous data if not loading previous
    
    with sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH) as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        for episode in range(num_sequences):
            # ... (scenario selection and episode generation)
            for data in episode_data:
                cursor.execute('''
                    INSERT INTO expert_data (state_sequence, action_index, reward, next_state)
                    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
                ''', data)
        conn.commit()  # Commit the changes to the database

def make_model_from_expert_data(env, num_sequences, load_previous=False):
    generate_expert_data(env, num_sequences, load_previous)  # Generate expert data
    model = TrainingModel(env)  # Create a training model with the environment
    return model
```

### Comparison
1. **MaxEnt RL**: The implementation doesn't explicitly use MaxEnt RL as in the research. However, it incorporates a similar principle in the reward function:

   ```python
   def step_reward_function(self, action, training=False, cats_needed=1):
       reward = -0.01  # Base step cost
       # ... (other reward calculations)
       current_state = (*self.position, self.direction)
       if current_state not in self.visited_states:
           reward += 0.1  # Reward for visiting a new position-direction pair
           self.visited_states.add(current_state)
       # ... (more reward calculations)
   ```

   This reward for visiting new states encourages exploration and diverse behavior, similar to the entropy maximization in MaxEnt RL.

2. **Reward Function Learning**: The research iteratively updates the reward function. The implementation uses a fixed reward function but includes various factors that capture task-specific rewards:

   ```python
   def step_reward_function(self, action, training=False, cats_needed=1):
       # ... (reward calculation based on actions and environment state)
       if self.position in self.cat_positions:
           reward += 1.0  # Positive reward for reaching a cat position
       if self.position in self.dog_positions:
           reward -= 5.0  # Negative reward for encountering a dog
       # ... (more reward calculations)
   ```

3. **Policy Representation**: Both use neural networks for policy representation. The implementation uses a dual network architecture:

   ```python
   class DualNetworkPolicy(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, input_size=15, hidden_size=64, num_actions=3):
           self.main_network = RecurrentNeuralNetworkRewardNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, num_actions)
           self.short_term_context_network = ShortTermContextNetwork()
   ```

4. **Expert Data Generation**: The implementation uses multiple expert policies to generate diverse training data, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the research algorithm.

### Detailed Comparison with Comments

```python
# Input: Demonstrations D, Policy class Π, Reward class ℱ
# Output: Trained policy π
# In our code: We don't explicitly define these inputs and outputs. Instead:
# - Demonstrations D are generated by multiple expert policies:
# realistic_expert = RealisticExpertPolicy(env)
# perfect_expert = ExpertPolicy(env)
# negative_expert = NegativeExpertPolicy(env)
# random_policy = RandomPolicy(env)
# - Policy class Π is implicitly defined by our DualNetworkPolicy
# - Reward class ℱ is replaced by our fixed reward function

# Initialize the first reward function f1 from the class ℱ
Initialize f1 ∈ ℱ
# In our code: We use a fixed reward function defined in step_reward_function:
# def step_reward_function(self, action, training=False, cats_needed=1):
#     reward = -0.01  # Base step cost
#     if self.position in self.cat_positions:
#         reward += 1.0
#     if self.position in self.dog_positions:
#         reward -= 5.0
#     # ... (more reward calculations)

# Iterate over a number of iterations N
for i in 1 … N do
    # In our code: We generate episodes using different expert policies:
    # for episode in range(num_sequences):
    #     scenario = random.choices([
    #         {"cats": 1, "dogs": 1, "weight": 0.1},
    #         {"cats": 2, "dogs": 1, "weight": 0.1},
    #         # ... (more scenarios)
    #     ], weights=[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3])[0]
        
    #     state = env.reset(cats_count=scenario["cats"], dogs_count=scenario["dogs"])
    #     while not done and move_count < 100:
    #         policy_choice = random.random()
    #         if policy_choice < 0.5:
    #             action = realistic_expert.act(state, training=True)
    #         elif policy_choice < 0.7:
    #             action = perfect_expert.act(state, training=True)
    #         elif policy_choice < 0.9:
    #             action = negative_expert.act(state, training=True)
    #         else:
    #             action = random_policy.act(state, training=True)
    #         # ... (execute action and store data)

    # Update the policy πi using MaxEntRL with a weighted sum of previous rewards
    πi ← MaxEntRL(r = 1/i ∑ j=1 to i fj)
    # In our code: We train the model using the generated expert data:
    # def train(self, num_iterations=1000, batch_size=16):
    #     for iteration in range(num_iterations):
    #         batch = next(batch_generator)
    #         states, actions, rewards, next_states = zip(*[self.parse_row(row) for row in batch])
    #         loss = self.train_on_batch((states, actions, rewards, next_states))

    # Update the reward function fi+1 to maximize the difference between expert policy πE and current policy πi
    fi+1 ← arg max f ∈ ℱ J(πE, f) − J(πi, f)
    # In our code: We don't

 update the reward function. It remains fixed throughout training.

end for

# Return the policy πi with the lowest validation error
Return πi with the lowest validation error.
# In our code: We return the trained model after all iterations:
# return model
# Note: We don't explicitly compute validation error. Instead, we evaluate the model's
# performance during the reinforcement learning phase and curriculum learning.
```

## 2. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

### Research Approach
The research presents a Deep Q-Learning algorithm [2]:

```python
# Initialize replay memory D with capacity N
# Initialize action-value function Q with random weights
Initialize replay memory D with capacity N
Initialize action-value function Q with random weights

# Iterate over episodes
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    # Initialize state s
    Initialize state s
    for t in range(max_steps):
        # Choose action a from state s using epsilon-greedy policy
        Choose action a from state s using epsilon-greedy policy
        # Take action a, observe reward r and next state s'
        Take action a, observe reward r and next state s'
        # Store experience (s, a, r, s') in D
        Store experience (s, a, r, s') in D
        # Sample random mini-batch of experiences (s_j, a_j, r_j, s'_j) from D
        Sample random mini-batch of experiences (s_j, a_j, r_j, s'_j) from D
        # Compute target:
        # if s'_j is terminal:
        if s'_j is terminal:
            y_j = r_j
        else:
            y_j = r_j + gamma * max(Q(s'_j, a'))
        # Perform a gradient descent step on (y_j - Q(s_j, a_j))^2
        Perform a gradient descent step on (y_j - Q(s_j, a_j))^2
        # Update state s = s'
        Update state s = s'
        if s is terminal:
            break
```

### Implementation
The RL implementation is part of the `train_phase_two` method:

```python
def train_phase_two(self, num_iterations=1000, batch_size=16, max_attempts=100, cats_count=3, dogs_count=3):
    while successful_episodes < num_iterations:
        results = self.parallel_generate_episodes(max_attempts, env_params, cats_count, dogs_count)
        if results:
            best_episode_data, best_cats_reached, best_dogs_encountered = max(results, key=lambda x: x[1])
            if best_episode_data:
                new_data.extend(best_episode_data)
                successful_episodes += 1

                if len(new_data) >= batch_size:
                    loss = self.train_on_batch(new_data[:batch_size], curriculum=False)
                    new_data = new_data[batch_size:]
                    self.losses_phase_two.append(loss)
```

### Comparison
1. **Experience Collection**: Instead of a replay buffer, the implementation generates episodes in parallel and selects the best ones:

   ```python
   results = self.parallel_generate_episodes(max_attempts, env_params, cats_count, dogs_count)
   best_episode_data, best_cats_reached, best_dogs_encountered = max(results, key=lambda x: x[1])
   ```

2. **Action Selection**: The implementation uses the trained neural network for action selection:

   ```python
   def select_safe_action(self, state, env: SimulationGridEnvironment):
       # ... (action selection logic using the neural network)
   ```

3. **Value Function Updates**: The implementation uses a more general loss function that combines the main network and short-term context network:

   ```python
   def train_on_batch(self, batch, curriculum=False):
       # ... (loss calculation for main network and short-term context network)
       total_loss = main_loss + short_context_loss
       total_loss.backward()
       self.optimizer.step()
   ```

4. **Parallel Execution**: The implementation uses parallel processing to generate episodes, which is an efficiency improvement not present in the research example.

        Update state s = s'
        # In our code: This is handled implicitly in the environment step function

        if s is terminal:
            break
        # In our code: We check for termination in the environment step function
```

## 3. Curriculum Learning

### Research Approach
The research presents a complex algorithm (IRL-HC) that combines inverse reinforcement learning with curriculum learning [3]:

```python
# Result: policy π
# (i) Initialization: Calculate µ(πE) with expert trajectories;
# Set i = 0, set ε, γ, α, bu, bl, cu, cl, p, eu, Nu;
# Randomly set the model parameters θ(0) for π(0);
# Compute µ(π(0));
# Set w(0)m such that kw(0)mk2 < 1 (initial reward weights), w(0)l = 0;
# Compute ε(0) = (w(0))T(µ(πE) − µ(π(0))), where w(0) = [w(0)m w(0)l];
# Set ∆(0), n(0)s;

# Initialize variables and parameters
Initialization: Calculate µ(πE) with expert trajectories;
Set i = 0, set ε, γ, α, bu, bl, cu, cl, p, eu, Nu;
Randomly set the model parameters θ(0) for π(0);
Compute µ(π(0));
Set w(0)m such that kw(0)mk2 < 1 (initial reward weights), w(0)l = 0;
Compute ε(0) = (w(0))T(µ(πE) − µ(π(0))), where w(0) = [w(0)m w(0)l];
Set ∆(0), n(0)s;

# Iterate while the difference ε(i) is greater than a threshold ε
while ε(i) > ε do
    # Increment iteration count
    Set i = i + 1;
    # Compute the reward function R
    Compute the reward function R = ((w(i−1))T φ);
    # Using the reward function and previous model parameters, compute the optimal policy π(i)
    Using R, θ(i−1), and n(i−1)s in RL to compute an optimal policy π(i);
    # Compute the feature expectations of the current policy
    Compute µ(π(i));
    # Solve an

 optimization problem to update ε(i) and w(i)
    Solve Optimization 1 with ∆ = ∆(i−1), and get solution ε(i) at w(i);
    # Check if the updated values satisfy a condition
    if Eq. 2 is True then
        Accept ε(i) and w(i);
    else
        Reject, solve Eq. 1 with ∆ = 0, and update ε(i) and w(i);
    end
    # Update the trust region ∆(i)
    Set ∆(i) with Eq. 3 (trust-region update);
    # Update the curriculum difficulty n(i)s
    Set n(i)s with Eq. 5 (curriculum difficulty update);
end
```

### Implementation
The curriculum learning approach is implemented as follows:

```python
def curriculum_training(model: TrainingModel, num_iterations=1000, batch_size=32):
    stages = [
        {'cats': 3, 'dogs': 0, 'obstacles': False},
        {'cats': 2, 'dogs': 0, 'obstacles': False},
        # ... (more stages)
        {'maze': True},
    ]

    for stage_index, stage in enumerate(stages):
        while stage_iterations < iterations_per_stage:
            episode_data = []
            for _ in range(batch_size):
                if stage.get('maze', False):
                    episode_data.extend(generate_maze_episode(env, expert))
                else:
                    episode_data.extend(generate_curriculum_episode(env, expert, stage))
            loss = model.train_on_batch(episode_data, curriculum=True)
```

### Comparison
1. **Reward Function**: The implementation uses a fixed reward function across all stages, while the research learns the reward function.
2. **Curriculum Progression**: The implementation uses predefined stages, while the research dynamically updates the curriculum difficulty.
3. **Policy Updates**: The implementation uses standard gradient descent, while the research uses trust region updates.
4. **Task-Specific Scenarios**: The implementation includes specific scenarios like maze navigation, which are tailored to the robot's task.

    # In our code: We update our model based on the loss from the current batch:
    # loss = model.train_on_batch(episode_data, curriculum=True)
    # model.curriculum_losses.append(loss)

    # Update the trust region ∆(i)
    Set ∆(i) with Eq. 3 (trust-region update);
    # In our code: We don't use trust region updates, but we do track performance across stages

    # Update the curriculum difficulty n(i)s
    Set n(i)s with Eq. 5 (curriculum difficulty update);
    # In our code: Our curriculum difficulty is defined by the stages, and we have stage-specific logic:
    # if stage.get('maze', False):
    #     episode_data.extend(generate_maze_episode(env, expert))
    # else:
    #     episode_data.extend(generate_curriculum_episode(env, expert, stage))
end)

## 4. Neural Network Architecture

### Research Approach
The research provides LSTM equations for handling sequential data [4]:

```text
# LSTM equations for handling sequential data
# it: input gate, ft: forget gate, gt: cell candidate, ot: output gate
# σ: sigmoid activation function, ⊙: element-wise multiplication

it = σ(Wii xt + bii + Whi ht-1 + bhi)
ft = σ(Wif xt + bif + Whf ht-1 + bhf)
gt = tanh(Wig xt + big + Whg ht-1 + bhg)
ot = σ(Wio xt + bio + Who ht-1 + bho)
ct = ft ⊙ ct-1 + it ⊙ gt
ht = ot ⊙ tanh(ct)
```

### Implementation
The implementation uses a combination of LSTM and fully connected networks:

```python
class RecurrentNeuralNetworkRewardNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=15, hidden_size=64, num_actions=3, num_layers=1, seq_length=15):
        super(RecurrentNeuralNetworkRewardNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers=num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_actions)

class ShortTermContextNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=7):
        super(ShortTermContextNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 32)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(32, 16)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(16, 1)

class DualNetworkPolicy(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=15, hidden_size=64, num_actions=3):
        super(DualNetworkPolicy, self).__init__()
        self.main_network = RecurrentNeuralNetworkRewardNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, num_actions)
        self.short_term_context_network = ShortTermContextNetwork()
```

### Comparison
1. **LSTM Usage**: The implementation uses PyTorch's LSTM module, which encapsulates the equations from the research.
2. **Dual Network Architecture**: The implementation introduces a dual network architecture not present in the research, combining long-term planning (LSTM)

 with immediate reactivity (Short-Term Context Network).
3. **Sequence Handling**: The implementation processes sequences of states and actions:

   ```python
   def get_memory_state_sequence(self):
       state_sequence = list(self.state_history)
       action_sequence = list(self.action_history)
       
       # Pad sequences if they're not full
       while len(state_sequence) < SEQUENCE_LENGTH:
           state_sequence.insert(0, np.zeros(state_length))
           action_sequence.insert(0, np.zeros(len(ACTIONS)))
       
       state_sequence = [np.array(s).flatten()[:state_length] for s in state_sequence]
       
       state_sequence = np.array(state_sequence).flatten()
       action_sequence = np.array(action_sequence).flatten()
       
       return np.concatenate((state_sequence, action_sequence))
   ```

4. **Rich State Representation**: The implementation uses a more complex state representation, including sensor data and robot direction.
5. **Decision Making**: The implementation combines the main network and short-term context network for action selection:

   ```python
   def select_safe_action(self, state, env: SimulationGridEnvironment):
       state_tensor = torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32).view(1, SEQUENCE_LENGTH, -1).to(device)
       with torch.no_grad():
           action_values = self.forward(state_tensor)
           sorted_actions = torch.argsort(action_values, descending=True)[0]

       for action_index in sorted_actions:
           action = ACTIONS[action_index.item()]
           if env.check_if_move_possible(action):
               action_encoding = [0, 0, 0]
               action_encoding[ACTIONS.index(action)] = 1
               input_data = torch.tensor(np.concatenate([camera_data, action_encoding]), dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
               safety_score = self.short_term_context_network(input_data).item()
               
               if safety_score >= self.safety_threshold:
                   return action
   ```

## Conclusion

While the implementation draws inspiration from various research concepts, it adapts them pragmatically for the specific robot navigation task. Key innovations include:

1. The use of multiple expert policies for diverse training data.
2. A dual network architecture combining long-term planning with short-term reactivity.
3. Task-specific reward shaping and curriculum stages.
4. Parallel episode generation for efficient training.

These adaptations result in a more specialized solution for the robot navigation problem, balancing theoretical concepts with practical implementation needs.
